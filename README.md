# xOpera deploy of simple thumbnail generator example to AWS Lambda

**Note**: This is still only a sandbox - working example with a plenty of room for optimisation. 

prerequisites:
* install AWS modules `botocore`, `boto3`, configure your AWS credentials
* prepare a zip including the lambda application (or take one prepared form [here](https://github.com/radon-h2020/FaaS-thumbnail-generator-python), find it in `binary-zip` put at your machine as `/tmp/X-test-ImageRes.zip`) note the **/tmp** folder!
* similarly, as current version of xOpera does not support `lookup` function, the path is currently fixed in to `/tmp/policy.json`, please copy it there initiating the:
	 `cp playbooks/aws_role/policy.json /tmp/`
* the latest version of Ansible (`2.9` will be ok, but currently `devel` is required). To install devel version: ```pip install git+https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git@devel```
* modify values of properties in `resize_service_opera.yml`, where appropriate (aws regions, bucket names, etc.)
* find opera orchestrator here: https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera, install it and run this blueprint with

`opera deploy <some deploy name> resize_service_opera.yml`
